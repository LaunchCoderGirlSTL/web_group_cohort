# Welcome

## Intro

We will present the same information several times before you will be expected to actually comprehend it all and really understand it, this is normal even after you leave CoderGirl. 

You are also expected to work 10-15 hours outside of the meetups, people who have done really well have put in up to 20-25 hours a week.

We will be building an Angular project complete with a CSS framework. You will also need to interact with an external API to get data or to help display something cool on the page. LaunchCode estimates you will spend around 100 hours on this project, but we will be doing some of this together to help get people kicked off.

Tips for succeeding:
* Ask questions early! Don't hang onto questions you have on Thursday until next week's meetup, you probably have the same questions as somewhere else.
* Spend a little time every day working, even if it is just reviewing notes, videos, or code.
* Working in a distracting environment does not count as working. You need to spend dedicated time to concentrate on working through difficult problems and really learning the new material.
