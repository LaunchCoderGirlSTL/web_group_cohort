### At CoderGirl
* [ABC Lesson 102](https://stackblitz.io/github/AngularBootCamp/template-events)

### Do On Your Own
1. Catch two more events triggered by user input. You can see a list
   of available events here:

    * When you press down on the "Clock In" button, have the text say "Clocking in as an employee/manager" as appropriate
    * When you press down on the "Clock Out" button, have the text say "Clocking in as an employee/manager" as appropriate
    * When you click on a day in the schedule, have the times at the bottom also show the day. Example: "Wednesday: 9:00-3:00"
2. "Bonus" activity: when you press a "secret key" (that you decide, for example "q"), have a smiley face appear on the page.
