# Lesson 100

## Intro to Angular

### This Lesson's Focus
* Go over what a SPA is an why we are using Angular for this.

### At CoderGirl
* Introduction to Single Page APPs (SPAs)
* Introduction to Angular and why we are teaching it

### Do On Your Own
* Watch the [Getting Started with Angular](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-angular) videos on Egghead.io
    * You are not expected to have learned Angular by watching these videos. Right now, they are to simply give you an introduction to the concepts. This is a very fast-paced set of videos, and we will be going over the material later in more detail, as well as reviewing individual videos later.
    * Watch the videos through twice, I'd suggest turning the auto-play off to not overload your brain and expect to space this out over a few days. I'm a senior dev and I found them fast paced. Again, this is just to get you to hear the terms before we start in on the lessons.
