# Welcome

## Intro

Welcome to CoderGirl's Front-End Web Developer project track!

Here you will continue learning Javascript, as well as learn Angular, Bootstrap, and how to get a project strated. The goal of this track is to complete your LaunchCode application project.

### Approach & Expectations

We will present the same information several times before you will be expected to actually comprehend it all and really understand it, this is normal even after you leave CoderGirl. 

You are also expected to work 10-15 hours outside of the meetups, people who have done really well have put in up to 20-25 hours a week.
