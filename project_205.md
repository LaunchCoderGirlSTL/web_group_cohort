# Lesson 205

## Component Inputs

### This Lesson's Focus
* Learn how to send data from one component to another component

### At CoderGirl
* [ABC Lesson 205](https://stackblitz.io/github/AngularBootCamp/component-inputs)

### Do On Your Own
* Move the sample data from VideoListComponent to
 VideoDashboardComponent and pass it down into the VideoListComponent.
* Make a component that represents a single video in the list.
* Update your `*ngFor` to use that component instead of plain HTML.
* Use component data binding to supply the data for each video entry.
* Verify that clicking a video still results in visually identifying
 the selected video.
