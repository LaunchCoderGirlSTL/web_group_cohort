# Pick your Project

### What you will need in your project
* We will be building an Angular project complete with a CSS framework. You will also need to interact with an external API to get data or to help display something cool on the page. LaunchCode estimates you will spend around 100 hours on this project, but we will be doing some of this together to help get people kicked off.
* We will not actually be storing this data in a database, we can work around this by using local storage. We also don't usually get to having users actually log in with their own accounts.

### Project Ideas (taken from past CoderGirls)
* Park app (with several features taken from 3 different projects, none of them had all of these things)
    * Allows users to find different parks and what trails are there
    * Users can comment on differnt parks
    * Users can view photos of those parks
    * Users can view the current weather at the park
* Public Transit Application
    * Users can view on a map what bus/metro stations there are for St. Louis
    * Users can comment on these different stations and rate them in their safety, as well as what's there/nearby
* Art Gallery
    * Users can see a list of art some has made
    * Users can purchase the art on the site
    * Users can find out more about the artist
* Stadium Tracker
    * Users can see on a map and in a list the different Baseball stadiums
    * Users can indicate that they have been there or not

### Do On Your Own
* If you have a project idea, write that up. If you have multiple, write them all up!
* If you don't have a project idea, come up with things you are interested in or passionate about. Use the inspiration above and we can help you figure out a projec to do.
* The important thing is to come up with something you are passionate about that you will want to continue tinkering with, even after the project track is completed.
* Submit this to the "Pick Your Project" assignmet in [Canvas](https://learn.launchcode.org)
