### Workshop
*In your video project in VS Code*
* Add an HTML form to the stat filters component, attach a FormGroup
  object to it, and populate it with several reactive form controls.
* Add a button to the form, and `console.log` the value of the form when the button gets clicked
* Don't forget that you'll need to import the ReactiveFormsModule to
  make Angular's form-handling features available to your application.
